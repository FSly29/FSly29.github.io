<h2 class="centertext"> AVATAR The Way of Water is about Jake Sully and his mate Neytiri and their kids which are Neytam, Lo'ak, Tuk, and their adoptive daughter Kiri. The Sully family will have to learn the way of water, and learn how to survive and live with the Metkayina Clan. The Recoms have a mission which is to hunt down and kill Jake Sully. Lo'ak becomes friends with a tulkun that is named Payakan that is the outcast. Kiri is different sometimes she goes to the biolab and when she is in the biolab she visits Grace Augustine's avatar that is in a amnio tank. It is a really good movie there is a character that has epilepsy which is Kiri which is really awesome and amazing and she is so awesome. You see some and a few more different kinds of creatures which are the creatures that live in the water which are Ilu's, Skimwing's called Tsurak by the navi, and also Tulkun's and Tulkun calf's. The creatures are awesome and amazing also really cool. Everyone will love and enjoy the movie because it is amazing and there is so many cool things and I really loved the movie. The Tulkun's are the Navi in the Metkayina Clan's spirtiual brothers and sister. When the Navi in the Metkayina Clan are in the water sometimes the do and use their fingers to talk which is a different kind of finger talk they sometimes do it to talk the tulkun's. It is amazing and interesting how they do it and did it. The movie is three hours long once you wa<!--can you start on a new paragraph?-->tch it all the way and don't stop it </h2>
