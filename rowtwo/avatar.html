    <hr class="hrblue">
    <h2 class="centertext"> AVATAR The Way of Water is about Jake Sully and his mate Neytiri and their kids which are Neytam, Lo'ak, Tuk, and their adoptive daughter Kiri. The Sully family will have to learn the way of water, and learn how to survive and live with the Metkayina Clan. The Recoms have a mission which is to hunt down and kill Jake Sully. Lo'ak becomes friends with a tulkun that is named Payakan that is the outcast. Kiri is different sometimes she goes to the biolab and when she is in the biolab she visits Grace Augustine's avatar that is in a amnio tank.
    It is a really good movie because there is a character that has epilepsy which is Kiri who is really awesome and amazing. You see a few more different kinds of creatures that live on the planet Pandora which are the creatures that live in the water which are Ilu's, Skimwing's called Tsurak by the navi, and also Tulkun's and Tulkun calf's. The creatures are awesome, amazing also really cool. Everyone will love and enjoy the movie because it is amazing and there is so many cool things and I really loved the movie.</h2>
    <h2 class="centertext"> The Tulkun's are the spiritual brothers and sisters of the navi that are in the Metkayina Clan. When the Navi in the Metkayina Clan are in the water sometimes the do and use their fingers to talk which is a different kind of finger talk they sometimes do it to talk the tulkun's. 
    It is amazing and interesting how they do it and did it. I know that it takes a long time for the AVATAR films to get made and put together. The AVATAR films are really awesome, imaginative, and amazing.
